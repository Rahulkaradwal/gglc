        <p className="text-sm lg:text-[1rem] font-semibold">
          Green Gear Logistics was founded by Kumar Kosuri, whose passion for
          innovation led to a vision of transforming last-mile delivery. What
          began as an effort to improve the delivery of big & bulky items
          evolved into a mission to provide smarter, greener, and more reliable
          logistics.
